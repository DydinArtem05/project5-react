# Social Network on React Js + Redux :eyes:
### How I came to project idea ?
When i started learn React i found React Js playlist which called ***Way of Samurai***.
In this playlist author tell about React and it's possibilities in tandem with Redux.
The main idea it's make Social Network which students can upgrade after course etc. He maded server on which my network is working and can made everything what i want (within reason and what the server allows :smile:).

### About project and it's possibillities
Project is made on React + Redux tandem as i said earlier. Social network should be similar to real network.

**Possibillities**
- Login page it's a place where you can log in account and edit profile or do a dialog, dialog realized with local state. Login page will showed for user when user want to visit profile page or dialog page without loginning. Also login page have captcha.  
- Profile page in which we can change our account avatar, change our name, status and make new posts, but new posts are deleted after refreshing page, because it's realized by local state.
- Dialogs page is place where user chatting with friends, but friends are imaginary and new messages in chat are deleted after refreshing page, because it's local state.
- Friends page, on this page user can follow of unfollow another real user or view his page. Also if user scroll down he will see paginator which will allow you to quickly see what users are available.
- On left side of page user will see navbar to move on project
- on top side of page is header, where user can click to login or if user loginned, he can click on down arrow and log out from account.
